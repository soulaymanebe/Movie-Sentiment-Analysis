# Movie-Sentiment-Analysis


The Movie Sentiment Analysis using Deep learning in keras project involves developing a neural network
artificial intelligence capable of identifying and recognizing feelings. This is a binary classification problem whose
target (output) is the feeling which can be in two states: “positive” or “negative” and the input variable (input)
will be represented by the review.


We will use three different types of deep neural networks: 
        -The densely connected neural network (Basic Neural Network), 
        -The convolutional neural network (CNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN). 
        -Long Short term Memory Network (LSTM), which is a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks. 
        
        
In addition, we will see how to evaluate a deep learning model on completely new data. 
All modules and functions used in this problem are imported from the "keras" framework. in our project.


The dataset on which we do our learning contains 50,000 samples and two columns: opinion and feeling.
The review column contains the text of the review and the sentiment column contains the sentiment of the review.
sentiment can have two values, namely “positive” and “negative”.


The dataset is accessible through the following link : shorturl.at/bmoB5
